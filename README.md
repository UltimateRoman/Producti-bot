# WHAT IT DOES

**Producti-Bot** is a Discord bot that helps set agendas for organisations of schedules for it's users so you never miss a task ever again and improve your productivity! 

The main command prompts that have been enabled on it (which have been made accessible by sending an !help command to the bot) are: 
 
1) **!task {time (using the 24 hour format)} {task description}** — _helps a user organise their tasks by adding them to a queue_.
 
2) **!schedule** — _which displays the current list of scheduled tasks and their statuses, completed or not_.

3) **task statuses** — the emojis, check marks, cross marks and an x, signify _mark as complete_, _mark as incomplete_ and _delete_ respectively.
 
4) **!reminder {time (using the 24 hour format)} {reminder message}** — _sets a reminder for a given time_.

5) **!timezone {UTC +/- offset}** — _lets the user set their own timezone for task reminders_.

N.B.: Only task creators can tamper with the to-do lists they create.
